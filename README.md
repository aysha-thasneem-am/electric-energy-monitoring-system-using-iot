Smart electricity billing offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional energy billing by using IoT devices to monitor and manage appliance usage. It eliminates bill production/distribution, reduces billing errors, enables daily budgeting, and adjusts consumption based on income.

The concept of smart electricity billing offers a cost-effective alternative to the current energy billing system, which is costly, discrete, slow, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. Traditional billing identifies power consumption through monthly electricity bills, but it lacks detailed insights into the energy usage of individual devices. This approximation prevents effective energy management and cost reduction.

Smart electricity billing addresses these issues by using IoT devices to monitor and manage the energy consumption of each appliance. By connecting devices to IoT, users can set conditions and timers to automatically track usage, enabling better control over high-energy-consuming devices. This can significantly reduce billing charges and save energy.

Moreover, smart meters can automatically track payments and send notifications to mobile devices if payments are overdue, enhancing convenience and reliability. This system benefits both customers and suppliers in several ways:

- Eliminates the need for bill production and distribution
- Shifts responsibility for disconnection to the customer
- Allows for load limitation
- Enables time-based usage for convenience
- Eliminates billing errors
- Facilitates daily budgeting
- Adjusts consumption based on the consumer's income
- Provides accurate consumption costs
- Resolves billing and reading issues

In summary, implementing a smart electricity billing system is efficient, cost-effective, and highly beneficial for energy management.
